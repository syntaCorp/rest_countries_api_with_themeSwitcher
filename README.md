## Project Objective 📃
 Your challenge is to integrate with the <a href="https://restcountries.com/">REST Countries V3 API</a> to pull country data and display it like in the designs (see attachments). You are required to use the React + TypeScript front-end framework. However, you have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

## Requirements ⛳
### Your users should be able to: 
1. View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size 
2. See all countries from the API on the homepage 
3. Search for a country using an input field 
4. Filter countries by region 
5. Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page 
6. Click through to the border countries on the detail page 
7. Toggle the colour scheme between light and dark mode
